## terms
### random sampling
- sample is random selected from the population
### 10% rule
- rule for independence
- sample size is no more than 10% of the population the sample is derived from
### large counts condition
- only applies to sampling distributions for the mean
- sample size must be greater than or equal to 30

## 1 sample z interval for population mean
### conditions
- data must be random ([[#random sampling]])
- data must be independent ([[#10% rule]])
- data must meet the [[#large counts condition]] or already be normal
### calculations
$stderr = \frac{stddev}{\sqrt n}$
$t* = (\text{find from table B})$
$\overline x \pm (t*) stderr$
